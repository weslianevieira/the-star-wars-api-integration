## Star Wars API Integration

### 💬 Description

In this application, I primarily used the axios library for making requests to the SWAPI API: [SWAPI](https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation#intro). I chose Vite + React to create the application. I developed the code using Class Components, props, and array manipulation in JavaScript. The entire layout was done using the Chakra UI framework.
